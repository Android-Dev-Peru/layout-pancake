# Layout Pancake

This repository contains a collection of layout examples built using the `ConstraintLayout`
support library to explore its feature set and demonstrate how it can build more
complex layouts without nesting `ViewGroup` elements. Examples will be added over
time.

# Disclaimer

This repository contains sample code intended to demonstrate the capabilities of the `ConstraintLayout` API. It is not intended to be used as-is in applications as a library dependency—or a stand-alone production application—and will not be maintained as such. Bug fix contributions are welcome, but issues and feature requests will not be addressed.
